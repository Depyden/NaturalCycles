## How to set-up the project

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate the project folder. Run `cd <folder-name>`
3. Run `npm install` to install all neccesary dependencies
4. run `ng serve --open` to start and open the project

The project is now running on `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## What can be improved

- The app could be covered with more precise unit tests
- The color scheme could be changed because of accesibility problems (font color and background have low contrast) (consider the call with designer)
